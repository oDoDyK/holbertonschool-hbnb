# HBnB Evolution

## 📌 Project Overview

HBnB Evolution is a simplified, educational version of an Airbnb-like application.  
The project is designed to demonstrate the principles of **software architecture**, **object-oriented design**, and **layered system organization**, following a progressive development approach.

The application allows users to manage properties, reviews, and amenities while enforcing clear business rules and structured interactions between system components.

This repository serves as the foundation for the HBnB Evolution project and will be incrementally expanded across multiple development phases.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Design a clean and scalable application architecture
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Use UML diagrams to model system structure and behavior
- Separate concerns using a layered architecture
- Prepare a solid blueprint for future implementation phases

---

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

The system follows a **three-layered architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Exposes services and APIs for client interaction
   - Acts as the entry point to the application

2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Contains the core domain models and business rules
   - Handles validation, relationships, and application logic

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Responsible for data storage and retrieval
   - Abstracted to allow flexibility in storage implementation

Communication between layers is handled through a **Facade pattern**, ensuring loose coupling and clear separation of responsibilities.

## 🧩 Core Domain Entities

The system is built around the following core entities:

- **User**
  - Represents application users (regular users or administrators)

- **Place**
  - Represents properties listed by users

- **Review**
  - Represents user feedback for places

- **Amenity**
  - Represents features that can be associated with places

Each entity:
- Is uniquely identified by an ID
- Tracks creation and update timestamps
- Supports basic CRUD operations

## 📐 Design Documentation

This repository includes technical documentation created during the initial design phase, such as:

- High-level package diagrams illustrating system layers
- Detailed class diagrams for the Business Logic layer
- Sequence diagrams showing API interaction flows
- Explanatory notes describing design decisions and interactions

These documents serve as a **technical blueprint** that guides the implementation in later stages of the project.

## 🚀 Project Status

🔹 **Current Phase:** Technical Documentation and System Design  
🔹 **Implementation:** To be developed in subsequent phases  
🔹 **Persistence & API Layers:** Planned for future parts

## 📚 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended to:

- Act as a reference for system architecture and design
- Support incremental development across multiple project phases
- Provide clear documentation for future implementation work

---

## 📝 Notes

- This project is developed for educational purposes.
- The design is intentionally modular to support future extensions.
- Detailed implementation will be introduced progressively in later phases.
